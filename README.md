# MinecraftPlugins
This tab in my profile is made to talk about my Minecraft Plugins.

## Language used:
- As preference I decided to use denizen;
- So don't forget, create a server to apply ur plugins!
- I really recommend following the [Denizen Biginner's Guide](https://guide.denizenscript.com/) to learn more about coding your own plugins.

### Can I use your plugins?

Yes! They are completely available for anyone to take no strings attached!
Tho feel free to share my page it helps me grow and share my plugins to the world!

## [No block breaking challange!](https://github.com/rode-lim/MinecraftPlugins/tree/main/NoBlocks)
Have you ever tried to beat MC without being able to break a block with your friends? No?

Anyways you can now!

Recommended use:
- Servers with custom buildings that u don't want destroyed;
- Fun challange with your friends? Can you beat the Ender Dragon?
In case you missed it click [HERE]() to open the code itself.
(Should I make a no block placing plugin too?)
