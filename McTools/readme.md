### Introductions:

Welcome to my biggest scale project in denizen to date!

Have you ever felt that sometimes Minecraft breaks the law's of physics?

Well I certainly did. Let's be honnest it makes the game better.
The fact that thing's can float is a charm.

However I've decided to make myself a challange to make TOOLS in Minecraft great again!

```
So what's the current objective and plans?
```

### The Project:

The project is still under heavy devlopment but the idea is simple:
- Tool changes:
    - You can only break blocks with the specific items. (For example, Dirt requires a Shovel)
    - Axes break all logs of the tree and leafs -OR- Axes make trees fall making it easier to reach the remaining logs.
- Building:
    - You need a certain Level to place blocks, I mean after all do you know how to build a house in real life? No? Excatly you would need to study and ur XP Level will be ur studies.
- More features to be added...
